Demonstrate it by getting the chains for members 12 and 22. Results table should have member and recommender, ordered by member ascending, recommender descending.

Answer
WITH RECURSIVE upward_rec(member, recommender) AS (
  SELECT memid, recommendedby
  FROM cd.members
UNION ALL
  SELECT u.member, m.recommendedby
  FROM upward_rec AS u JOIN cd.members AS m ON m.memid = u.recommender
)
SELECT up.member, up.recommender, me.firstname, me.surname
FROM upward_rec AS up JOIN cd.members AS me ON up.recommender = me.memid
WHERE up.member IN (12, 22)
ORDER BY up.member, up.recommender DESC;
