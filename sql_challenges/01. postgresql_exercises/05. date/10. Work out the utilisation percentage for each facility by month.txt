Question
Work out the utilisation percentage for each facility by month, sorted by name and month, rounded to 1 decimal place. Opening time is 8am, closing time is 8.30pm. You can treat every month as a full month, regardless of if there were some dates the club was not open.

Answer
SELECT bf.name, bf.month, ROUND(bf.slots * 100.0 / (25 * EXTRACT(day FROM bf.month + INTERVAL '1 month' - bf.month)), 1) AS utilisation
FROM (SELECT f.name, DATE_TRUNC('month', b.starttime) AS month, SUM(b.slots) AS slots
      FROM cd.bookings AS b JOIN cd.facilities AS f ON b.facid = f.facid
      GROUP BY f.name, month) AS bf
ORDER BY bf.name, bf.month;
