Question
For any given timestamp, work out the number of days remaining in the month. The current day should count as a whole day, regardless of the time. Use '2012-02-11 01:00:00' as an example timestamp for the
purposes of making the answer. Format the output as a single interval value.

Answer
SELECT (DATE_TRUNC('month', TIMESTAMP '2012-02-11 01:00:00') + INTERVAL '1 month') - 
       DATE_TRUNC('day', TIMESTAMP '2012-02-11 01:00:00') AS remaining;
