Question
Produce a list of facilities along with their total revenue. The output table should consist of facility name and revenue, sorted by revenue. Remember that there's a different cost for guests and members!

Answer
SELECT f.name, SUM(CASE WHEN b.memid = 0 THEN b.slots * f.guestcost
                        ELSE b.slots * f.membercost
                   END) AS revenue
FROM cd.bookings AS b JOIN cd.facilities AS f ON b.facid = f.facid
GROUP BY f.name
ORDER BY revenue;
