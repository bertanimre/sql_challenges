Question
Produce a list of the total number of hours booked per facility, remembering that a slot lasts half an hour. The output table should consist of the facility id, name, and hours booked, sorted by facility id.
Try formatting the hours to two decimal places.

Answer
SELECT f.facid, f.name, CAST(SUM(b.slots) / 2.0 AS DECIMAL(10, 2)) AS total_hours
FROM cd.bookings AS b JOIN cd.facilities AS f ON b.facid = f.facid
GROUP BY f.facid, f.name
ORDER BY f.facid;
