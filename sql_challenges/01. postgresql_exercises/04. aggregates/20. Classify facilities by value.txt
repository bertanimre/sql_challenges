               END AS revenue
FROM (SELECT r.name, NTILE(3) OVER (ORDER BY revenue DESC) AS group
      FROM (SELECT f.name, SUM(CASE WHEN b.memid = 0 THEN b.slots * f.guestcost
                                    ELSE b.slots * f.membercost
                               END) as revenue
            FROM cd.bookings AS b JOIN cd.facilities AS f ON b.facid = f.facid
            GROUP BY f.facid, f.name) AS r) AS g
ORDER BY g.group, g.name;
