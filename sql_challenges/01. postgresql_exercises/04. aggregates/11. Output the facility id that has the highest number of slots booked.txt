Question
Output the facility id that has the highest number of slots booked. For bonus points, try a version without a LIMIT clause. This version will probably look messy!

Answer
WITH sums AS (SELECT facid, SUM(slots) AS total_slots
              FROM cd.bookings
              GROUP BY facid)
SELECT facid, total_slots
FROM sums
WHERE total_slots = (SELECT MAX(total_slots) FROM sums);
