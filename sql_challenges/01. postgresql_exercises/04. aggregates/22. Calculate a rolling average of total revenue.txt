Question
For each day in August 2012, calculate a rolling average of total revenue over the previous 15 days. Output should contain date and revenue columns, sorted by the date. Remember to account for the possibility
of a day having zero revenue. This one's a bit tough, so don't be afraid to check out the hint!

Answer
SELECT dates.date, (SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN b.memid = 0 THEN b.slots * f.guestcost
                                    ELSE b.slots * f.membercost
                               END) AS revenue
                    FROM cd.bookings AS b JOIN cd.facilities AS f ON b.facid = f.facid
                    WHERE b.starttime > dates.date - INTERVAL '14 days' AND b.starttime < dates.date + INTERVAL '1 day') / 15 AS avg_rev
FROM (SELECT CAST(GENERATE_SERIES(TIMESTAMP '2012-08-01', '2012-08-31','1 day') AS date) AS date) AS dates
ORDER BY dates.date;
