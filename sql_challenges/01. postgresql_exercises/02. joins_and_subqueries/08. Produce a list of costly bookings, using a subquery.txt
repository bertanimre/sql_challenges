Question
The Produce a list of costly bookings exercise contained some messy logic: we had to calculate the booking cost in both the WHERE clause and the CASE statement. Try to simplify this calculation using subqueries.

Answer
SELECT CONCAT(m.firstname, ' ', m.surname) AS member, bf.name, bf.cost
FROM (SELECT b.memid, b.starttime, f.name, CASE WHEN b.memid = 0 THEN b.slots * f.guestcost
                                                ELSE b.slots * f.membercost
                                           END AS cost
      FROM cd.bookings AS b JOIN cd.facilities AS f ON f.facid = b.facid) AS bf
      JOIN cd.members AS m ON m.memid = bf.memid
WHERE bf.starttime < '2012-09-15' AND bf.starttime > '2012-09-14' AND bf.cost > 30
ORDER BY bf.cost DESC;
