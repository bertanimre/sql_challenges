Question
How can you output a list of all members, including the individual who recommended them (if any), without using any joins? Ensure that there are no duplicates in the list, and that each firstname + surname
pairing is formatted as a column and ordered.

Answer
SELECT DISTINCT CONCAT(m.firstname, ' ', m.surname) AS member, 
                (SELECT CONCAT(r.firstname, ' ', r.surname) AS recommender
                 FROM cd.members AS r
                 WHERE m.recommendedby = r.memid) 
FROM cd.members AS m
ORDER BY member;
