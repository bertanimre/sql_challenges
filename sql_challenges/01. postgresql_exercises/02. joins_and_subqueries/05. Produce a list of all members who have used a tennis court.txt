Question
How can you produce a list of all members who have used a tennis court? Include in your output the name of the court, and the name of the member formatted as a single column. Ensure no duplicate data, and order by the member name followed by the facility name.

Answer
SELECT DISTINCT CONCAT(m.firstname, ' ', m.surname) AS member, f.name AS facility
FROM cd.members AS m JOIN cd.bookings AS b ON  m.memid = b.memid
     JOIN cd.facilities AS f ON f.facid = b.facid
WHERE f.name IN ('Tennis Court 1', 'Tennis Court 2')
ORDER BY member, facility;
