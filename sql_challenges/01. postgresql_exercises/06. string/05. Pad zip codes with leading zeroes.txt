Question
The zip codes in our example dataset have had leading zeroes removed from them by virtue of being stored as a numeric type. Retrieve all zip codes from the members table, padding any zip codes less than 5
characters long with leading zeroes. Order by the new zip code.

Answer
SELECT LPAD(CAST(zipcode AS TEXT), 5, '0') AS zip
FROM cd.members
ORDER BY zip;
